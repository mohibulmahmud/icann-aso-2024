# My Experience at the ICANN ASO Information Session üåç  

On **November 12, 2024**, I had the opportunity to participate remotely in the ICANN Address Supporting Organization (ASO) Information Session via Zoom. This session focused on the proposed updates to the **ICP-2** document, which outlines how Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are governed, operate, and remain accountable.  

This blog captures my takeaways, questions, and how you can get involved in shaping the future of Internet governance.

## Why Update ICP-2?  

The **ICP-2 document**, originally created in 2001, has served as a guide for recognizing and managing RIRs. However, with advancements in technology, governance, and the evolving Internet ecosystem, an update was long overdue. The new version aims to:  

- **Enhance Transparency:** RIRs will now need to publish detailed records of governance, finances, and regular audits.  
- **Improve Accountability:** Clearer criteria are being set for RIRs to ensure they continue to meet community standards.  
- **Ensure Stability:** New measures are included to avoid disruptions and maintain smooth operations.  

The updates are designed to strengthen the Internet‚Äôs backbone while ensuring that RIRs remain community-driven and operate responsibly.

## My Questions and Insights  

During the session, I had the opportunity to ask a few important questions. Here‚Äôs what I learned:  

1. **How will the updates improve accountability for RIRs?**  
   - New principles like transparency, audits, and continuity plans will hold RIRs to higher standards and ensure they remain accountable to their communities.  

2. **What role does the Internet community play in monitoring accountability?**  
   - Transparency mechanisms, like published records and independent audits, will allow the community to keep track of RIR activities. Community input is critical for improving these updates.  

3. **What happens if an RIR doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria?**  
   - ICANN and other RIRs have pledged to provide support, including financial and operational assistance, to help struggling RIRs meet the requirements. Derecognition would only be considered as a last resort.  

4. **Are there ideas missing from the update?**  
   - ICANN welcomes community feedback! If there are additional principles that could improve accountability, now is the time to share them through the public comment process.
